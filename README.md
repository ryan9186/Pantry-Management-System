# Pantry-Management-System

## Overview
Managing a home kitchen can be a daunting task. Within a kitchen you can have a huge array of ingredients, and at any given time the value of the food items stored within the kitchen may be worth hundreds to thousands of dollars. Knowing what you have on hand, how much you have on hand, and how soon something may spoil can be difficult. It is also quite easy to use something up, forget about it, and never add it to your shopping list. 

## Objective
The Pantry Management System allows a user to keep track of exactly what food items they have available, and where that item is stored within their kitchen. The system will also be able to keep track of how much of an ingredient is left and alert the user if any of their pantry items have gone past their expiration dates. Additionally, the system can create a shopping list based on any items that have run out or are within danger of running out. By utilizing the system, the user will have a much easier time planning meals and grocery shopping trips.
